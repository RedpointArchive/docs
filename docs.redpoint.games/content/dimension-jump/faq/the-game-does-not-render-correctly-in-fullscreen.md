On some systems, Dimension Jump may not render correctly in fullscreen mode.  This is caused by high DPI screen configurations.  You can either run the game in windowed mode, or set your DPI to 100%.

## Setting your DPI to 100% on Windows 10

Open the Settings from the Start Menu, then select Display here:

{{< img "../dpi1.png" >}}

Under Scale and Layout, make sure the "Change the size of text, apps and other items" is set to 100%:

{{< img "../dpi2.png" >}}

**After changing this setting, you will need to logout and log back in before running Dimension Jump.**
